# Tutorials

These are guided walkthroughs. Each one builds something working, with just enough context to understand why the steps exist.

- [Your first schema in five minutes](first-schema.md)
- [Secure local dev with OIDC/JWKS](local-oidc.md)
- [Query with filters and unique keys](query-basics.md)
- [Vector search with embeddings](vector-search.md)
- [Operations with guardrails](ops-guardrails.md)

Optional sample data:
